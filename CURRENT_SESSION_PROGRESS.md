# Current Session Progress: Drag and Drop Functionality

## Objective
Implement drag and drop functionality for the markdown editor that:
1. Accepts file drops into the editor
2. Copies files to `src/assets/[collection]/` in the Astro project
3. Renames files with date prefix and kebab-case
4. Handles naming conflicts
5. Inserts appropriate markdown links/images

## Progress Completed

### 1. âœ… Research Phase
- Discovered that Tauri has its own drag/drop system that conflicts with web APIs
- Found that `fileDropEnabled` was renamed to `dragDropEnabled` in Tauri v2
- Identified that we need to use Tauri's event system (`tauri://drag-drop`)

### 2. âœ… Basic Drag and Drop Implementation
- Added `dragDropEnabled: true` to `tauri.conf.json`
- Implemented Tauri event listeners for `tauri://drag-drop` events
- Added CodeMirror's `dropCursor()` extension for visual feedback
- Successfully receiving dropped file paths

### 3. âœ… Markdown Formatting
- Files are automatically formatted as markdown links: `[filename](path)`
- Images (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, svg, bmp, ico) formatted as: `![filename](path)`
- Multiple files supported (one per line)

### 4. âœ… Backend File Copy Command
Created `copy_file_to_assets` Tauri command that:
- Creates `src/assets/[collection]/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Converts filenames to kebab-case (e.g., "My Image.png" â†’ "my-image.png")
- Adds date prefix (e.g., "2024-01-15-my-image.png")
- Handles conflicts by appending numbers (e.g., "2024-01-15-my-image-1.png")
- Returns the relative path from project root

### 5. ðŸš§ Frontend Integration (In Progress)
- Updated `handleTauriFileDrop` to call the backend command
- Need to fix TypeScript error: `currentCollection` not found in AppState

## Current Issue

The store doesn't have a `currentCollection` property. Need to determine how to get the current collection context - either from:
- The currently opened file's collection
- A selected collection in the UI
- The current file path

## Next Steps

1. Fix the `currentCollection` issue by:
   - Checking how collections are stored in the app state
   - Getting collection from current file context
   - Or adding collection tracking to the store

2. Test the complete flow:
   - Drag image into editor
   - File gets copied to `src/assets/[collection]/2024-01-15-image-name.png`
   - Markdown image inserted: `![image-name.png](/src/assets/[collection]/2024-01-15-image-name.png)`

3. Handle edge cases:
   - No project open
   - No file/collection selected
   - Large files
   - Permission errors

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Added `dragDropEnabled: true`
2. `src/components/Layout/EditorView.tsx` - Implemented Tauri drag/drop handling
3. `src-tauri/src/commands/files.rs` - Added `copy_file_to_assets` command
4. `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered new command
5. `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added `chrono` dependency

### Key Functions:
- `handleTauriFileDrop()` - Processes dropped files in the frontend
- `copy_file_to_assets()` - Rust command that copies and renames files
- `to_kebab_case()` - Converts filenames to kebab-case format
