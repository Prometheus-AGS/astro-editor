# Current Session Progress: Drag and Drop Functionality ✅

## Objective - COMPLETED
Implement drag and drop functionality for the markdown editor that:
1. ✅ Accepts file drops into the editor
2. ✅ Copies files to `src/assets/[collection]/` in the Astro project
3. ✅ Renames files with date prefix and kebab-case
4. ✅ Handles naming conflicts
5. ✅ Inserts appropriate markdown links/images

## Progress Completed

### 1. ✅ Research Phase
- Discovered that Tauri has its own drag/drop system that conflicts with web APIs
- Found that `fileDropEnabled` was renamed to `dragDropEnabled` in Tauri v2
- Identified that we need to use Tauri's event system (`tauri://drag-drop`)

### 2. ✅ Basic Drag and Drop Implementation
- Added `dragDropEnabled: true` to `tauri.conf.json`
- Implemented Tauri event listeners for `tauri://drag-drop` events
- Added CodeMirror's `dropCursor()` extension for visual feedback
- Successfully receiving dropped file paths

### 3. ✅ Markdown Formatting
- Files are automatically formatted as markdown links: `[filename](path)`
- Images (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, svg, bmp, ico) formatted as: `![filename](path)`
- Multiple files supported (one per line)

### 4. ✅ Backend File Copy Command
Created `copy_file_to_assets` Tauri command that:
- Creates `src/assets/[collection]/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Converts filenames to kebab-case (e.g., "My Image.png" → "my-image.png")
- Adds date prefix (e.g., "2024-01-15-my-image.png")
- Handles conflicts by appending numbers (e.g., "2024-01-15-my-image-1.png")
- Returns the relative path from project root

### 5. ✅ Frontend Integration
- Updated `handleTauriFileDrop` to call the backend command
- Fixed TypeScript error: changed from `currentCollection` to `currentFile.collection`
- Proper error handling in place

### 6. ✅ Edge Case Handling
- When no project is open: Shows error and inserts original file paths as fallback
- When no file is open: Shows error and inserts original file paths as fallback
- When file copy fails: Falls back to original file path
- Handles permission errors gracefully

### 7. ✅ Test Coverage
Added comprehensive Rust tests for:
- `to_kebab_case` function with various edge cases
- `copy_file_to_assets` with successful copy
- Handling naming conflicts
- Directory creation when assets folder doesn't exist
- All tests passing (42 Rust tests, 83 JS tests)

## Implementation Complete

The drag and drop functionality is now fully implemented with:
- ✅ Tauri drag/drop event handling
- ✅ File copying to assets directory
- ✅ Proper file naming with date prefix and kebab-case
- ✅ Markdown link/image insertion
- ✅ Edge case handling
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

Users can now drag images and files into the editor, and they will be automatically copied to the appropriate assets folder with proper naming conventions and markdown formatting.
