My friend Vicki's "mate have you considered maybe youse got ADHD" was the first time I remember this topic coming up. That was maybe six years back, and I promptly forgot about it. Then, two years ago – while ADHD was all the rage on TikTok – my friend Janina had a period of revalation about herself and made me do a bunch of tests. Turns out I probably have Adult ADHD.

I read a couple of things this week which started me thinking about ADHD. And I'm thinking about AI because in June of 2025 it's hard to avoid. This 2024 piece from Schneems is a response to DHHs [rant](https://web.archive.org/web/20241121071802/https://world.hey.com/dhh/cold-reading-an-adhd-affliction-44163793) about ADHD.

He makes a lot of good points, but two bits cracked me up in relation to myself...

> My biggest behavioral issue was that I snuck books into class and read them under my desk. If your mental picture of someone with ADHD is an out-of-control “little monster,” then this seems like the opposite. I got through college with a degree, taught myself Ruby on Rails

I also snuck books into school to read under the desk. One teacher gave me a detention for it but others brought me _really interesting_ books from home (and in one case a giant stack of New Scientist magazines) and occasionally let me get away with reading _over_ the desk instead of doing whatever work I was supposed to be interested in. I also got through university with a degree and taught myself Ruby on Rails.

> One day, I was having an argument with my wife. It was about how I never planned dates. It got heated. She had to go to a meeting, and I planned to return to the conversation “Hey, how about we grab lunch after your meeting to talk it over.” I realized that I needed to meet the basic expectations of planning events and trying to compensate for them by taking action then and there. The suggestion might seem trite or pandering, but she thought it was good and agreed.

> An hour later, she walked into my office (garage), and I literally couldn’t remember why she was there. Or rather, I was in the middle of another task, and when she walked in, I had to rack my brain to quickly retrieve the info that would provide context to her: “I’m here.” It took a split second too long, and she noticed. Turns out that I don’t “have a good memory.” What I have is the ability to recall extremely detailed information about a situation, given that I’m primed with the context.

I laughed out loud at this. In the two years since Janina made me do those tests, we've laughed a lot at how differently this stuff affects each of us. The venn diagram of our symptoms barely overlaps. What Schneems describes here is not a thing for her at all, but it very much is for me. We live together, so she's seen (and been frustrated by) versions of this _a lot_ over the years. So also have a lot of my girlfriends. And collegues. And friends.

The last sentence is a wonderfully concise version of something I've always struggled to explain about myself: _"What I have is the ability to recall extremely detailed information about a situation, given that I’m primed with the context."_

I also stumbled upon this wonderfully creative site (which reminded me of the web back in the olden days)

When I'd stopped puzzling over how this was possibly made with Wix, I read over the list of symptoms. It's the first time for two years I've read through a list like this and I chuckled at how many describe me. I've circled those which I definitely experience (and I'm sure my friends would recognise!)

<Callout>
  Over the last 20 years I've developed **extremely good** mechanisms for dealing with many of these
  symptoms (without which I'd have circled *everything* above bar about four). I also have fairly
  good mechanisms for a lot of those I circled, but not yet to the extent that they no longer affect
  me.
