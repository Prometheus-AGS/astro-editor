# Task: Global NEw Note Window and Editor

A global keyboard shortcut which opens a new note window and allows for the creation of extremely quick notes. This window should be floating on top of everything else, without requiring the actual app to be open. Kind of like a quick entry panel. Press here to save the note and just close the panel. It should be possible to edit from matter easily here. We'd also need to have a preference to choose which collection is your kind of quick notes one. Or perhaps the ability to switch between them, And remember the last collection that was accessed. We don't need all of the editor features in this mini editor.
