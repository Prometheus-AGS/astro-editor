# Task: Astro Edito Website & Docs Site

https://github.com/dannysmith/astro-editor/issues/6

Create a simple, effective website for Astro Editor that serves as the primary marketing and documentation hub, hosted using GitHub Pages with automated deployment.

## Overview

Build a minimal but professional website that showcases Astro Editor's features, provides user documentation, and maintains a changelog. The site should be simple to maintain and automatically deploy from the main repository.

## Architecture Requirements

### Repository Integration

- Website code lives within this repository for unified maintenance
- Documentation sourced directly from `/docs` directory
- Automated deployment via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages
- Custom domain support for professional appearance

### Technology Stack

- Static site generator (to be determined during implementation)
- Off-the-shelf themes and components for rapid development
- Minimal custom styling to reduce maintenance overhead
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users

## Core Components

- Release notes with feature highlights and bug fixes

## Technical Considerations

### Deployment & Hosting

- GitHub Pages deployment with custom domain
- Automated builds triggered by repository changes
- CDN benefits for fast global loading

### Content Management

- Documentation stays in sync with codebase
- Automated changelog generation from git release history

### Performance & SEO

- Fast loading times with optimized assets

## Research Analysis (Jan 2025)

After extensive research into the simplest possible approaches for creating a stylish website, two compelling options emerged:

### Option A: Docsify (Zero Build Process) - **RECOMMENDED**

**Deployment Complexity:** ⭐ (Trivial)
**Styling Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

**Key Findings:**
- **Professional themes available** - "7 stunning Docsify themes" with modern features like gradient backgrounds and dark/light mode toggles
- **True zero-build process** - Everything renders client-side, just push markdown files to deploy
- **Beautiful out-of-the-box** - Much more sophisticated than basic HTML+markdown solutions
- **Perfect content fit** - Can handle the existing 385-line user guide + 9 images seamlessly
- **Plugin ecosystem** - Built-in search, alerts, flexible navigation capabilities

**File Structure:**
```
docs/
├── index.html (50 lines with Docsify + theme)
├── README.md (landing page content)  
├── user-guide.md (existing file, works as-is)
├── assets/ (existing images)
└── _sidebar.md (simple navigation)
```

**Pros:**
- **Literally just push files** - No GitHub Actions, no build process, immediate updates
- **Professional appearance** - Recent 2025 examples show stunning documentation sites
- **Perfect content alignment** - Designed exactly for documentation + marketing sites
- **Future-friendly** - Easy to add changelog as new markdown files
- **Upgrade path** - Can migrate to Astro later if needed, content transfers perfectly

**Cons:**
- **SEO limitations** - Client-side rendering isn't ideal for search engines
- **Initial load time** - Markdown parsed in browser (though modern browsers handle this well)

### Option B: Minimal Astro (Official Template)

**Deployment Complexity:** ⭐⭐ (Simple)
**Styling Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Exceptional)

**Key Findings:**
- **Official GitHub Pages template exists** - `github.com/withastro/github-pages` ready to use
- **Automatic deployment** - GitHub Actions pre-configured in template
- **Exceptional performance** - "Zero JS by default", "lightning fast loading"
- **Fast build times** - Go-based compiler, significantly faster than competitors like Docusaurus
- **Perfect brand alignment** - Astro Editor → Astro website makes conceptual sense

**Pros:**
- **Brand consistency** - Using Astro for Astro Editor creates perfect alignment
- **SEO optimized** - Static HTML generation, fast loading, search engine friendly
- **Scalability** - Easy to add advanced features, components, custom styling
- **Modern stack** - Future-proof, excellent developer experience

**Cons:**
- **Build step required** - GitHub Actions handle it automatically, but adds complexity
- **Learning curve** - Some Astro syntax to learn (though minimal for basic sites)

### Final Recommendation: Docsify

**Reasoning:**
1. **Simplicity alignment** - User emphasized "simplest possible" approach multiple times
2. **Content structure perfect match** - Existing user guide is exactly what Docsify excels at displaying
3. **Professional results achievable** - 2025 examples demonstrate stunning visual outcomes possible
4. **Zero maintenance overhead** - No build failures, version conflicts, or deployment issues
5. **Immediate gratification** - Push a file, see changes instantly on live site
6. **Low risk** - Can prototype in 30 minutes, upgrade to Astro later if requirements change

**Implementation approach:** Start with Docsify for immediate results, with clear upgrade path to Astro if advanced features become necessary later.
