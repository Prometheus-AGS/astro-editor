# Task: Prerelease Tasks

- [ ] Add custom App icons and confirm all package/app metadata is correct
- [ ] Add "About" dialog and menu item etc
- [ ] Add a "Preferences" menu item under "Astro Editor" macoOS menubar menu which opens the settings. The correct coyboard shortcut is `Cmd+,` which already works. Do this in the same way you have with other Tauri menubar items.
- [ ] Update all docs:
  - [ ] Create `docs/developer_guide.md` with comprehensive documentation on the project and how everything works, written for a human audience. Organise docs folder properly.
  - [ ] Write a short, punchy README.md
  - [ ] Add user guide to docs
  - [ ] Review all non-code files for things which can be removed
  - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to remove all info on roadmap/planning etc and just contain optimal instuctions for working effectively on this project in the future.
