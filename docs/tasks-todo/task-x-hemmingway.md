# Task: Hemingway-style Writing Assistant

https://github.com/dannysmith/astro-editor/issues/5

Implement a writing analysis mode that provides real-time readability feedback and style suggestions, similar to the Hemingway Editor, to help users write clearer and more concise content.

## Overview

Add an optional writing analysis overlay to the markdown editor that highlights problematic sentences and suggests improvements. This feature should help users identify and fix common writing issues like passive voice, complex sentences, and unnecessary qualifiers.

## Core Features

### Readability Analysis

- Calculate and display overall readability grade level (e.g., "Grade 6 - Good")
- Real-time word count tracking
- Sentence complexity analysis
- Reading difficulty assessment

### Text Highlighting System

- **Yellow highlighting**: Long, complex sentences that should be shortened or split
- **Red highlighting**: Very dense, hard-to-read sentences that need significant revision
- **Blue highlighting**: Adverbs and weakening phrases that can be removed
- **Green highlighting**: Passive voice phrases with suggestions for active alternatives
- **Purple highlighting**: Complex phrases with simpler alternatives available

### Interactive Suggestions

- Hover tooltips showing specific improvement suggestions
- Click-to-replace functionality for simple word substitutions
- Contextual recommendations for sentence restructuring
- Alternative word suggestions (e.g., "utilize" â†’ "use")

### User Interface

- Toggle to enable/disable writing analysis mode
- Sidebar panel showing readability statistics and summary
- Color-coded feedback system that's non-intrusive
- Option to focus on specific types of issues (passive voice, adverbs, etc.)

## User Experience

Users should be able to:

- Write normally with optional real-time feedback
- Quickly identify problem areas through color-coded highlights
- Get specific, actionable suggestions for improvements
- See immediate impact of changes on readability score
- Focus on writing without being overwhelmed by suggestions

## Technical Implementation

### Analysis Engine

- Real-time text parsing and analysis
- Sentence-level readability scoring
- Pattern matching for common writing issues
- Performance optimization for large documents

### Integration

- Seamless integration with existing CodeMirror editor
- Non-blocking analysis that doesn't interrupt typing
- Configurable analysis sensitivity and rules
