# Task: Search

- Fuzzy search functionality (by filename and title [if present] only).
- Probably best to have this via the command palette somehow.
- Main goal is to make it quicker to find and edit documents in the current projects.
- Unlikeley to be used heavily by users, since most editing will be on recent articles.
- The UI needs to be fast and snappy, and intuative.
