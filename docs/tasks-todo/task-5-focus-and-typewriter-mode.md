# Task: Focus and Typewriter Mode

## Focus mode

Like iA Writer - Current sentence and/or paragraph is coloured normally, everything else is greyed out.

## Typewriter mode

Like iA Writer - The currently selected line is always in the middle of the Editor window And the content vertically scrolls up and down as Needed to maintain this. Would normally be combined with focus mode to allow you to focus only on the current thing you're writing. May require some interesting CSS gradients at the very top and bottom so it looks like the text is fading.
