# Task: Apple Signing

I need to sign the app with an Apple **Developer ID Application** certificate.

See https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/#creating-a-signing-certificate

I should be able to test this locally but I also need it set up with the automated deployment system. So the GitHub Action when it builds a new release does this properly.
