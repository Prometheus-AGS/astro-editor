# Task: Website

## Pre-Work

Decide on the best way of doing this. Ideally, the website code Will live in this repo. The landing page itself will be simple. The user guide should be in this repo, and the developer documentation should also live in this repo so that it's available to AI tools when working. This would also allow GitHub Actions to build and deploy the website, and it would allow me to actually use GitHub Pages and a custom domain to host the website. However, it may add complexity where it isn't necessary. I should check out the best way of handling this.

As far as styling goes, I should keep this as simple as humanly possible, use off-the-shelf themes and components to build this stuff out.

## Part One - Landing Page

Build a simple, good-looking landing page which shows off the features of the editor and allows users to download it.

## Part Two - User Guide

A simple user guide (one page), probably rendered from a Markdown document in here.

## Part Three - Changelog/Blog

A simple page which shows releases and changes. Entries here can be auto-generated by the build and release step, but I can also add manual entries. Probably best built as a single-page timeline view. The blog entries here will only be me explaining changes to how the app works.
