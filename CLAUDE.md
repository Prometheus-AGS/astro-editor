# Claude Instructions for Astro Blog Editor Project

## Project Overview

This is a native macOS markdown editor specifically designed for managing and editing Astro content collections. The goal is to create a beautiful, distraction-free writing environment that understands Astro's content structure and provides seamless frontmatter editing, inspired by iA Writer's design philosophy.

## Core Rules

### New Sessions

- Always read `docs/initial-prd.md` and `docs/tasks.md` to understand project context and current status
- Check the git status and project structure to understand what's been implemented

### Progress Tracking

- **CRITICAL:** After completing any major work, update `docs/tasks.md` and mark completed items with `[x]`
- When moving between phases, update the planning document to reflect current status
- If you complete multiple related tasks, update them all at once to keep the plan current

### Development Approach

- We are taking a phased approach to development outlined in `docs/tasks.md`
- **Current Status**: Phase 2.3 (UI refinement and code quality improvements) - partially complete
- Each phase has specific deliverables - ensure these are met before moving to the next phase

## Technology Stack (IMPLEMENTED)

- **Framework:** Tauri v2 (Rust backend + React frontend)
- **Text Editor:** CodeMirror 6 with markdown support
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript (strict mode)
- **State Management:** Zustand with persistence
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 + shadcn/ui components (v4 upgrade planned)
- **Icons:** Lucide React + Radix UI icons
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library (frontend), Cargo test (backend)
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, Clippy with comprehensive configurations

**CRITICAL:** This project uses Tauri v2. Always refer to Tauri v2 documentation. Many Tauri v1 approaches do NOT work in v2.

- Test data enhancement

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

- Polish and performance optimizations (Phase 4)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements

- **TypeScript:** Strict typing required, no `any` types
- **React:** Use modern patterns (hooks, function components)
- **State Management:** All state through Zustand store
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and user-friendly messages
- **Performance:** Target <2s app launch, <100ms file operations

### Component Patterns

- Use shadcn/ui components over custom implementations
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries

### Styling Guidelines

- **Primary:** Use Tailwind utilities over custom CSS
- **Spacing:** `p-4` for panels, `gap-2` for small spacing, `gap-4` for larger
- **Icons:** `h-4 w-4` for standard icons, `h-8` for toolbar buttons
- **Colors:** Use CSS variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, etc.)
- **Responsive:** Use `overflow-hidden` with `text-ellipsis` for long text

## Available Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev              # Start Tauri dev server
npm run tauri:dev        # Alternative Tauri dev command
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run tauri:build      # Build Tauri app
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Frontend
npm run lint             # ESLint checking
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run format           # Prettier formatting
npm run format:check     # Check Prettier formatting
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type checking

# Backend
npm run rust:fmt         # Format Rust code
npm run rust:clippy      # Clippy linting
npm run rust:clippy:fix  # Auto-fix Clippy issues

# Combined
npm run check:all        # Run all checks (TS + Rust + tests)
npm run fix:all          # Auto-fix all issues
```

### Testing

```bash
# Frontend Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
npm run test             # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run         # Run tests once
npm run test:ui          # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report

# Backend Tests (Cargo)
npm run rust:test        # Run Rust tests

# All Tests
npm run test:all         # Run both frontend and backend tests
```

## Testing Strategy

A dummy astro project with most of the relevant files exists at `dummy-astro-project`

### Frontend Testing

- **Store tests:** State management and async operations
- **Component tests:** Rendering and user interactions
- **Error handling:** API failures and edge cases
- **Mocked APIs:** Use `globalThis.mockTauri` for Tauri commands

### Backend Testing

- **Command tests:** File operations with temporary files
- **Model tests:** Data structure validation
- **Integration tests:** Complete workflows
- **Error scenarios:** Permission denied, file not found, etc.

## Architecture Patterns

### State Management

- Single Zustand store in `src/store/index.ts`
- Async actions for all file operations
- State persistence for project path and UI preferences
- Separation of UI state and file content state

### Frontmatter Form Generation

- Dynamic forms generated from Zod schemas in `lib/schema.ts`
- Support for string, number, boolean, date, enum, and array fields
- Real-time validation with error messages
- Sync between form state and file frontmatter

### File Operations

- All file I/O through Tauri commands
- File watching with debounced updates
- Auto-save every 30 seconds and on blur
- Frontmatter hidden from CodeMirror display

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Limitations

- Only supports standard Astro project structures
- Limited to basic Zod schema types
- Regex-based TypeScript parsing (improvement planned)
- macOS only (initial version)

## Key Files to Understand

### Essential Reading

- `docs/initial-prd.md` - Product requirements and vision
- `docs/tasks.md` - Implementation plan and current status
- `src/store/index.ts` - Application state management
- `src/lib/schema.ts` - Schema parsing and form generation
- `src/components/Layout/` - Main UI components

### Configuration Files

- `components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS setup
- `vitest.config.ts` - Testing configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri app configuration

## Best Practices

### Before Committing

1. Run `npm run check:all` to verify all tests and linting pass
2. Update `docs/tasks.md` with completed work
3. Ensure TypeScript compilation is clean
4. Ask the user to test manually in the app if UI changes were made

### When Adding Features

1. Check if shadcn/ui has a suitable component first
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Update types and interfaces as needed
4. Consider performance impact for large collections
5. Follow established patterns in existing code

### Code Review Checklist

- TypeScript types are properly defined
- Error handling is implemented
- Components are accessible and responsive
- Performance considerations for large files/collections
- Tests cover new functionality
- Documentation is updated if needed
