# Session Handoff - Astro Editor Development

## Current Status: Phase 1 Week 1 - MOSTLY COMPLETE

### What We Accomplished This Session

**âœ… COMPLETED:**
1. **Project Structure**: Set up complete Tauri + React + TypeScript project
2. **Backend Architecture**: Created full Rust backend with:
   - Models: `FileEntry`, `Collection` data structures
   - Commands: Project scanning, file operations, folder selection
   - Proper module organization following planned architecture
3. **Frontend Architecture**: Built complete React frontend with:
   - Zustand state management store
   - Full Layout component hierarchy (Sidebar, MainEditor, FrontmatterPanel, etc.)
   - Basic UI styling and responsive layout
4. **Integration**: Connected frontend to backend via Tauri commands

**ðŸ“‹ DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED:**
- Frontend: `zustand`, `@uiw/react-codemirror`, `@codemirror/lang-markdown`, etc.
- Backend: `rfd`, `notify`, `walkdir`, `tokio`, etc.

### What's Ready to Test
- Complete application structure is built
- All core components are implemented
- Basic file operations should work
- Project folder selection dialog
- Collections and files display in sidebar
- CodeMirror editor integration (basic)

### Blocking Issue: Rust Installation
**STOPPED HERE:** Need to install Rust toolchain to run the app

**Required Steps:**
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Restart terminal or source cargo
source ~/.cargo/env

# Verify installation
rustc --version
cargo --version

# Run the app
npm run tauri dev
```

### Next Steps After Rust Installation

1. **Test the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

2. **Verify Week 1 functionality**:
   - App launches successfully
   - "Open Project" button works (file dialog)
   - Collections appear in sidebar
   - Files appear when collection clicked
   - Basic file opening works
   - CodeMirror editor displays content

3. **Continue with Week 2 tasks**:
   - Implement file saving functionality 
   - Add file watcher for external changes
   - Enhance CodeMirror configuration
   - Fix any bugs found during testing

### Key Files Created This Session

**Backend (Rust):**
- `src-tauri/src/models/` - Data structures
- `src-tauri/src/commands/` - Tauri commands
- Updated `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Main entry point
- Updated `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Dependencies

**Frontend (React):**
- `src/store/index.ts` - Zustand state management
- `src/components/Layout/` - Complete UI components
- Updated `src/App.tsx` and `src/App.css` - Main app

**Configuration:**
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Window settings (1200x800, proper sizing)

### Architecture Notes
- Following exact plan from `planning.md`
- State management: Zustand with proper TypeScript types
- Backend: Modular Rust structure with proper error handling
- Frontend: Component-based with CSS modules
- File operations: Direct filesystem access via Tauri commands

### Known Issues to Address
1. **Error handling**: Need better error messages in UI
2. **File dialog**: Using `rfd` crate - may need macOS permissions
3. **CodeMirror theming**: Currently basic, needs iA Writer styling
4. **Frontmatter**: Panel exists but parsing not implemented yet

### Testing Strategy
Once app launches:
1. Test with a real Astro project (needs `src/content/` directory)
2. Verify collections detection works
3. Test file opening and basic editing
4. Check responsiveness of UI panels

Remember: Follow the `CLAUDE.md` rules - update `planning.md` after completing tasks and mark items with `[x]`.
